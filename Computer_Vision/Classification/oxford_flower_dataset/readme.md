# Classification Application: Oxford 102 Flowers Data set 

With CUDA toolkits Kaggle notebook, I used transfer learning to train a network on 🚀**NVIDIA TESLA P100 GPUs**🚀. I discovered that the main classification challenges 🧐 : include changes in **_illumination, inter-class similarity, and diverse background in the image_** 🧐. To do this, I used image transformation to normalise the image and data augmentation to boost the training data. To increase performance, I employed image segmentation techniques to eliminate the backdrop of the image and highlight the subject, as well as **_learning rate annealing_**. After that, I applied the ReLU activation function and updated the Resenet50's classifier architecture to include three fully-connected layers. On the validation set, this method had a classification accuracy of 95[%](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?95%), and on the test set, it had a classification accuracy of 95[%.](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?95%)
