# Classification Application: Oxford 102 Flowers Data set 

With CUDA toolkits Kaggle notebook, I used transfer learning to train a network on **NVIDIA TESLA P100 GPUs**. Changes in _illumination, inter-class similarities, and a diversified background_ in the image are among the key categorization issues I discovered. To do this, I used image transformation to normalise the image and data augmentation to boost the training data. To increase performance, I employed image segmentation techniques to eliminate the backdrop of the image and highlight the subject, as well as _learning rate annealing_. After that, I applied the ReLU activation function and updated the Resenet50's classifier architecture to include three fully-connected layers. On the validation set, this method had a classification accuracy of 95%, and on the test set, it had a classification accuracy of 95%.
