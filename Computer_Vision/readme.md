## Classification:  
<<<<<<< HEAD
Image classifier to recognize different species of flowers. We can imagine using something like this in a phone app that tells you the name of the flower your camera is looking at. In practice we'd train this classifier, then export it for use in our application. We'll be using this [dataset](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/index.html) of 102 flower categories, you can see a few examples below.
