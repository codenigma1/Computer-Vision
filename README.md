I have been solved various [**_Computer Vision_**](https://github.com/codenigma1/Deep-Learning/tree/master/Computer_Vision) :eyes: and [**_Natural Language Processing_**](https://github.com/codenigma1/Deep-Learning/tree/master/NLP) :brain: task using Deep Learning :rocket: techniques. One more research area I would like to work on Reinforcement Learning :robot: which I haven’t started due to my laxness :tired_face:. In the computer vision, I have solved [Classification problem](https://github.com/codenigma1/Deep-Learning/tree/master/Computer_Vision/Classification), [Neural Style Transfer](https://github.com/codenigma1/Deep-Learning/tree/master/Computer_Vision/Style_Transfer), [Autoencoder and Image Manipulation](https://github.com/codenigma1/DeepLearning/tree/master/Computer_Vision/AutoEncoder_and_Image_Mainpulation), [Image Generating using GANs](https://github.com/codenigma1/Deep-Learning/tree/master/Computer_Vision/GANs), and [Advance GANs](https://github.com/codenigma1/Deep-Learning/tree/master/Computer_Vision/Adavance_GANs) (Pix2Pix, CycleGAN, StyleGAN, and SRGAN). Another NLP directory, you will find basic language model but nothing special. I am looking for intersection research such as CV with NLP, CV with RL, CV, NLP, and RL.  I don’t like to work on the directly Jupyter Notebook; however, I noticed its good to put code for other people understanding. Therefore, you will be found Jupyter Notebook file :books: .
