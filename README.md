I have been solved various **_Computer Vision_** and **_Natural Language Processing_** task using Deep Learning techniques. One more research area I would like to work on Reinforcement Learning which I haven’t started due to my laxness. In the computer vision, I have solved Classification problem, Neural Style Transfer, Autoencoder and Image Manipulation, Image Generating using GANs, and Advance GANs (Pix2Pix, CycleGAN, StyleGAN, and SRGAN). Another NLP directory, you will find basic language model but nothing special. I am looking for intersection research such as CV with NLP, CV with RL, CV, NLP, and RL.  I don’t like to work on the directly Jupyter Notebook; however, I noticed its good to put code for other people understanding. Therefore, you will be found Jupyter Notebook file.
